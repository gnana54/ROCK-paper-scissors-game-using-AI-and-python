           OVERVIEW:  For this project we have implemented a minimal example of a game with these properties,
                       which we call “Rock-Paper-Scissors-with-state” (RPSWS). The rules of the game are as
                       follows:
           if hands:
                    playerMove = None
                    hand = hands[0]
                    fingers = detector.fingersUp(hand)
                    if fingers == [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]:
                        playerMove = 1
                    if fingers == [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]:
                        playerMove = 2
                    if fingers == [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]:
                        playerMove = 3 
                    # player wins
                    if (playerMove == 1 and randomNumber ==3) or \
                            (playerMove == 2 and randomNumber == 1) or \
                            (playerMove == 3 and randomNumber == 2):
                        scores[1] +=1
                    # AI wins  
                    if (playerMove == 3 and randomNumber == 1) or \
                           (playerMove == 1 and randomNumber == 2) or \
                           (playerMove == 2 and randomNumber == 3):
                        scores[0] += 1

CONCLUSION & FUTURE ENHANCEMENT: need to add encounters and rounds to the game.
